# We know we nneed the random module, so import it:
from random import randint

# Initialize the number of guesses (6)

# Generate a random number (import random module)

# Start while loop:

  # Ask the user to guess number (use input functions)

  # if the guess is just right then print "you win!" and break

  # If the guess is too high then print "too high"
  
  # If the guess is too low then print  "too low"

  # If player doesn't guess in the given number of turns - Game over, and break!
